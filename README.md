# Calculator Demo
This is a simple Rust-based application for managing basic calculator transactions. The system defines a `Transaction` struct, allowing the creation of new transactions with a sender, recipient, and an amount. It uses the `serde` library to serialize and deserialize the transaction data.

## Features
* **Create** new transactions with sender, recipient, and amount.
* **Serialize** and **deserialize** transaction data for easy storage and transmission.
* **Clone** transaction objects for further manipulation.

## Prerequisites
* Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* Clone the repo
