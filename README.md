# Transaction Management System

This is a simple Rust-based application for managing transactions. The system defines a `Transaction` struct, allowing the creation of new transactions with a sender, recipient, and an amount. It uses the `serde` library to serialize and deserialize the transaction data.

## Features
* **Create** new transactions with sender, recipient, and amount.
* **Serialize** and **deserialize** transaction data for easy storage and transmission.
* **Clone** transaction objects for further manipulation.
